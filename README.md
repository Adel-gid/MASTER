# MASTER Library
This library was created with the goal of replicating most of the algorithms and collecting them in simple C89 style compatible files.

Current available algorithms:
* SIMD MMX Emulator ("./source/simd_mmx.h");

Also available:
* Listing Some Useful Macros & Main Header File ("./source/master_enum.h");
* File For Architecture Detect And Define His Properties ("./source/architecture_detect.h");
* File For Detecting Available SIMD Instructions ("./source/simd_detect.h");
